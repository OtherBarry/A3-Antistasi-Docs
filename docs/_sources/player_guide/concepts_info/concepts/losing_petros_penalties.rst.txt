Losing Petros Penalties
========================

If Petros is killed by the Invaders or Occupiers, the following penalties will apply:

1. 90% of your HR will be lost
2. 90% of your money will be lost
3. You must select a new location for your HQ

A note to any would-be trolls: A player or some other accidental “ARMA magic” will not trigger these penalties in the event that Petros dies. He must be killed by someone from either of the two enemy factions.
