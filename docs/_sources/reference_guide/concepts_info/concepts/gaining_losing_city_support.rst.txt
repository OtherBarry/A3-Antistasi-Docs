Gaining and Losing City Support
=================================

******************
General Notes
******************

* Radio towers broadcast propaganda to towns within their range. The broadcast takes place on every resource check.
   * If you own a tower, it will gain you 1 support and take away 1 support from the Occupier. The opposite is true if the Occupier controls the tower. If the Invaders control the tower, you both lose support.  
   * The tower cannot increase support for the owner of the tower above 30% or decrease enemy support below 50%
* Most changes to support in a town are scaled inversely to the townâ€™s population. In other words, the larger the town the less your efforts impact the town.
* The Occupier and Invader enemy factions can also impact town support. When the Occupiers kill the Invaders they gain .25 support per kill. If an Occupier enemy dies to an Invader, the Occupier loses .25 support

******************
Gaining Support
******************

* Killing an enemy near the town will deduct 1 support from the enemy and add 1 to you
* Destroying a vehicle will gain you support and cost the Occupier support at the nearest town depending on what vehicle was destroyed. Roughly speaking, statics are worth the least, APCs and transport aircraft are worth 2 or so support, and tanks, AA, attack choppers, and fixed wing CAS are all worth around 3 support.
* If an Occupier enemy surrenders they lose 2 support
* If an Invader enemy surrenders you gain 1 support
* If you build a Roadblock or OP near a town, you gain 5 support while the enemy loses 5
* If you take an airfield, the nearest town will gain 10 support for you
* Rebuilding a map marker will get you 10 support for the nearest town
* If the Invaders or Occupier kill a civilian you gain 1 support
* The Steal or Destroy Armor mission will get you 5 or 10 support at the nearest town, depending on whether you stole the armor from the Invader or Occupiers. Failing it similarly loses you support.
* Successfully completing a convoy mission will gain you support in the destination town. The amount of support varies on difficulty and the type of convoy. 
* Killing an enemy roadblock will gain you 5 support or the enemy will lose 5 support depending on whether the Invader or Occupier owned the roadblock
* Resource Acquisition or Take the Outpost missions will subtract 5 or 10 support from the enemy depending on the difficulty. Failing these missions grant the enemy 5 or 10 support, again depending on difficulty
* Successfully completing a Logistics Mission will gain you 15 or 30 support and cost the enemy the same amount, depending on difficulty

******************
Losing Support
******************

* Stealing a car from a town will lose you 1 support
* Shooting a surrendered enemy will lose you 2 support
* Killing a civilian will lose you 1 support
* If a friendly unit is killed you will lose .25 support
* If a friendly player is killed, you will lose 1 support.
* If you bring the truck for the Bank Mission close enough to the bank to start the countdown, you will lose 20 or 40 support depending on difficulty. The enemy will gain 10 or 20 support. Again, this is just by starting the countdown, success or failure after that will not change the support further.
* If you lose an airfield, the enemy will gain 10 support in the nearest town
* If the Invaders take an airfield, both you and the Occupiers lose 10 support in the nearest town
* If you lose a roadblock, you will lose and the enemy will gain 5 support in the nearest town
* If you fail a Logistics Mission, you lose 5 or 10 support and the enemy gains the same, depending on an RNG roll related to War Level.
