=======================

Category
    :ref:`mission_category_destroy`

.. topic:: Description


  -  Destroy a radio tower to disrupt propaganda broadcast in the region.
  -  Sneak in or blast your way into the outpost and place explosives on the radio tower.
  -  You will need explosives to complete this mission.
  -  I recommend trying this at night with NVGs if possible.



.. topic:: Outcome

  *Note that cells which have two values separated by a / indicate that the reward or penalty depends on if the mission was created with a "difficulty" modifier. The difficulty modifier will make the mission harder but increase the payout. The exact formula is: if a random number 1-10 is lower than your War Level then make the mission harder but with higher payout.*
