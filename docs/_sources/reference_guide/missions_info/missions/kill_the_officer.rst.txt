   Description
   ^^^^^^^^^^^

   -  The mission is very similar to the “Kill the traitor” mission. The differences are that the unit is already at a established location like an airfield.
   -  Hence, he is protected by all the units within the area, which makes it harder to eliminate the target, unless you can snipe him or hit him with a mortar

   Outcome
   ^^^^^^^

   *Note that cells which have two values separated by a / indicate that the reward or penalty depends on if the mission was created with a "difficulty" modifier. The difficulty modifier will make the mission harder but increase the payout. The exact formula is: if a random number 1-10 is lower than your War Level then make the mission harder but with higher payout.*
