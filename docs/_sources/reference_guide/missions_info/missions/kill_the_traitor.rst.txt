Kill The Traitor
====================

Category
    :ref:`mission_category_assassination`

.. topic:: Description

   -  Someone betrayed the resistance and is ratting you out to the
      authorities. If the traitor makes it to an airbase, your HQ will be attacked.
   -  The traitor will usually be protected by around 2-3 squads of
      patrolling infantry.
   -  The traitor will be armed with a pistol and will always be indoors.
   -  Nearby, you will see a car parked outside. It differs in between mods what vehicle this is but for RHS it is a UAZ military vehicle.
   -  When you get close to the traitor, he will attempt to escape to his car and drive to the nearest airfield.
   -  Get near him, follow him to his car and follow him away out of town. Once it is safe, stop his vehicle with your truck, get out and kill him.
   -  OR you can attempt to kill his guards and the infantry protecting him. This will require some creative coordination or heavy fire power.
   -  The traitor will likely run to his vehicle once shots are fired. Shoot out his wheels so he cannot escape.
   -  You can find Intel on the Traitor’s family from dead enemy soldiers. This can be used by Petros to blackmail the Traitor into staying quiet.


.. topic:: Outcome

  *Note that cells which have two values separated by a / indicate that the reward or penalty depends on if the mission was created with a "difficulty" modifier. The difficulty modifier will make the mission harder but increase the payout. The exact formula is: if a random number 1-10 is lower than your War Level then make the mission harder but with higher payout.*
