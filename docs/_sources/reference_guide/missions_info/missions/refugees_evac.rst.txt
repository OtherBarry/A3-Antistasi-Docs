   Description
   ^^^^^^^^^^^

   -  Some gendarmes are guarding some refugees in a town. Kill the guards, recruit the refugees by using the drop-down menu on them, then take them back to HQ.
   -  Gendarmes are easy to kill so this should be easier than other missions.
   -  Make sure to take a large vehicle capable of carrying 6+ people.

   Outcome
   ^^^^^^^

   *Note that cells which have two values separated by a / indicate that the reward or penalty depends on if the mission was created with a "difficulty" modifier. The difficulty modifier will make the mission harder but increase the payout. The exact formula is: if a random number 1-10 is lower than your War Level then make the mission harder but with higher payout.*
