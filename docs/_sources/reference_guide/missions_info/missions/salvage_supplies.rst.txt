.. topic:: Description

  -  This mission is quite rare.
  -  It’s usually right by an enemy seaport and you have to find or buy a boat with a wench.
  -  Go to the place, look for the supplies, then use the winch to extract the supplies.


.. topic:: Outcome

  *Note that cells which have two values separated by a / indicate that the reward or penalty depends on if the mission was created with a "difficulty" modifier. The difficulty modifier will make the mission harder but increase the payout. The exact formula is: if a random number 1-10 is lower than your War Level then make the mission harder but with higher payout.*
