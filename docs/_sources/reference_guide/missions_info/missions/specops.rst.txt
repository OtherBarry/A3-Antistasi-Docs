   Description
   ^^^^^^^^^^^

   -  A squad of Special forces have been spotted nearby. You must eliminate this squad.
   -  Good way to get some sweet loot.
   -  First spot the enemy while undercover. Then ambush them.
   -  I find mortars and MGs are the easiest way to complete this mission but be careful, spec ops teams often spawn close to minefields

   Outcome
   ^^^^^^^

   *Note that cells which have two values separated by a / indicate that the reward or penalty depends on if the mission was created with a "difficulty" modifier. The difficulty modifier will make the mission harder but increase the payout. The exact formula is: if a random number 1-10 is lower than your War Level then make the mission harder but with higher payout.*
