Steal Or Destroy Armor
===========================

Category
    :ref:`mission_category_destroy`

.. topic:: Description

  -  Rare mission, but is an opportunity to get some firepower.
  -  I advise attempting to sneak into the vehicle and bolt before the enemy takes you out.

.. topic:: Outcome

  *Note that cells which have two values separated by a / indicate that the reward or penalty depends on if the mission was created with a "difficulty" modifier. The difficulty modifier will make the mission harder but increase the payout. The exact formula is: if a random number 1-10 is lower than your War Level then make the mission harder but with higher payout.*
