The History of Antistasi
==================================

   Antistasi has a long history of development. Starting from Barbolani, the original creator, over the old Community Dev Team to the current Community Dev Team.
   There are very different versions from us and even a ton more from other creators.
   Here we try to give an overview of how we got to the point which we are right now. And maybe even look a little bit into the future.

   History of Antistasi Mission and Community
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   | Once upon a time, Antistasi was created by Barbolani as a Guerilla warfare simulator for ArmA 3. To test this mission and report bugs this community was set up.
   | Over time the community also helped with development but mostly under the oversight of Barbolani himself, this proved quite hard at times because Barbolani works in mysterious ways (as I like to say) and prefers to work alone. He is not a professional coder (which makes the mission even more impressive in my opinion). He developed this mission as a side project, leads a busy life, and has a family to take care of so at times he is unavailable for a very long time.
   | In his period of inactivity, the community continued the coding process, and that's how 1.8.x, which 1.9 is a part of, became a thing. This means that 1.8 is older than 1.4 despite the higher number. Quite confusing, I know.
   | After Barbolani came back he disagreed with some changes the community made and continued on his own again - that's 1.4. This is also why 1.4 and 1.9 have so many different game mechanics and are not compatible in any way.
   | So now we have taken up dev work again and the story of Antistasi continues.
   | So you could say that 1.4 is Barbolanis' vision of guerilla warfare in ArmA while 1.8.x is the communities vision of Antistasi.
   | After the old Community Dev Team stopped development and bug fixing, the new Community Dev Team build the current stable Version 2.x based on Barbolanis 1.4.0.2 Version.

   TL;DR:

   - 1.8 and 1.9 are compatible
   - 1.4 is completely different
   - you cant compare 1.8/1.9 and 1.4 with eachother
   - 2.x is based on Barbolanis' 1.4.0.2
