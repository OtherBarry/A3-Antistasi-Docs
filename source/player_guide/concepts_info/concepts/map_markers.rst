Map Markers
=================

Map markers are the labeled areas on the map which have special significance within Antistasi. Capturing, holding, and losing these markers all have significant effects, so it’s important to understand how the changing frontlines of the war will impact your own position.

General Note: Capturing all map markers will provide a flat $50 payout to any player within the area of the marker when it is captured.

************************************************************
Resource
************************************************************

Resources are any variety of monetizable location in your AO like a mine or some other natural resource. Whoever controls the resource is able to convert the raw materials at that location into cash, so resources are vital to produce sustainable, consistent income for your faction. Resources typically have a weaker garrison than strictly military markers like airbases and outposts. Because they are often mines or other natural resources, it’s not uncommon for resource markers to be isolated well away from towns and other points of interest. Making them vulnerable to hit and run attacks.

**Capturing**

1. $300 per resource per income tick
2. Upon capture, the previous owner will have 20 more aggro for 2 hours

**Losing**

1. No aggro change

************************************************************
Factory
************************************************************
Factories act as a force multiplier for your income as they boost the amount of money you can generate. Although factories will give you a blanket boost to income from all sources (like the standard $25 per tick or passive income from controlling towns), they work most powerfully when you begin to capture resource markers. You can always charge more for a finished product instead of a pile of raw materials! Factory markers are garrisoned similarly to resources in that they are not defended like hardened military targets, but they also tend to be closer to towns and cities, so they are not as isolated.

**Capturing**

1. Each factory owned is a 25% income boost for all income. For example, if you own 2 resources and 2 factories: 2 resources is $600 of income per tick plus an additional 50% from the 2 factories for a total resource income of $900.
2. Upon capture, the previous owner will have 20 more aggro for 2 hours

**Losing**

1. No aggro change

************************************************************
Seaport 
************************************************************
A seaport is your quickest and easiest window to the outside world. Its garrisons tend to be around the same strength as factories and resources but occasionally they are a little better defended given their military significance. Denying an enemy access to seaports also prevents them from fielding their own boats which can be a major advantage depending on the geography of your AO.

**Capturing**

1. Each seaport provides a 50% boost to HR for each income tick
2. Each seaport provides a 10% discount on vehicles purchased from HQ
3. Ability to garage boats at seaports
4. Upon capture, the previous owner will have 20 more aggro for 2 hours

**Losing**

1. No aggro change

************************************************************
Outpost
************************************************************
Outposts are military bases, plain and simple. They are well-armed, well-garrisoned, and well-defended. Typically outposts are situated at pivotal points on the map as they are designed to protect other vital map markers. Take Outposts and Airbases in particular will contribute significantly to your war level, but holding on to outposts, or at least keeping their garrison decimated will allow for significantly freer movement of your forces. 

**Capturing**

1. If the outpost housed a radio tower, you now enjoy the benefits of that tower. See relevant article for more information on radio towers.
2. Upon capture, the previous owner will have 30 more aggro for 2.5 hour
3. Upon capture, the enemy faction that did NOT own the outpost will have -15 aggro for 1.5 hours 

**Losing**

1. Upon loss, the enemy faction that captured the outpost will have -10 aggro for 1.5 hours

************************************************************
Airbase
************************************************************
The only sustainable way to utilize air assets in your fight is to eventually capture and hold an airbase. Although capturing airbases raises the war level significantly, if you’re able to deal with the additional threat then an entire new dimension of war will open up for you. Airbases are quite sparse but are vitally important. Thus, they are heavily defended. The enemy will throw everything they’ve got at retaining airbases, and they will often be a hotly contested map marker not just between you and your enemy, but between occupier and invader factions as well. 

Note: You cannot capture airbases until war level 3

**Capturing**

1. If this is the first airbase your faction owns, capturing it unlocks ability to accumulate and use airstrikes
2. Increases number of airstrikes per income tick by .25
3. Ability to garage aircraft/helicopters at the airbase
4. Upon capture, 10 support for your faction in nearest town
5. Upon capture, the previous owner will have 50 more aggro for 2.5 hours
6. Upon capture, the enemy faction that did NOT own the airbase will have -25 aggro for 1.5 hours

**Losing**

1. Upon loss, 10 support for the occupier faction in the nearest town
2. Upon loss, the new owner will have -40 aggro for 1.5 hours
3. Upon loss, the enemy faction that did NOT own the airbase will have -20 for 1.5 hrs
