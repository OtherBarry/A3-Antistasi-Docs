   Description
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   HQ attacks can now only be launched once an enemy faction has full knowledge of your HQ. Knowledge is currently added when a traitor mission is failed, or when a support is called against a target near HQ. Knowledge diminishes slowly over time as long as it hasn't reached 1. Moving HQ will reset knowledge, as long as their wasn't a previous HQ nearby recently.

   The attacks themselves are still specops air, but benefit from improvements to combat behaviour. Support artillery and UAVs are also used to assist.
