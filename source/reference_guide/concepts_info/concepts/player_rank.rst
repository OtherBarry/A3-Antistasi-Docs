   Description
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Player Rank, as the name says, indicates what rank a player is within this particular Antistasi scenario. A variety of actions in Antistasi will grant or remove Player Score Points, but in general completing missions or killing the enemy will earn you these points. Similarly, failing missions can also subtract these points. Apart from bragging rights, Player Rank determines who will take over as Commander when the current Commander leaves or resigns. Higher ranking players have a higher chance of inheriting the Commander role when it becomes available.

   Below is a table of the attainable ranks and the requirements to be promoted. Note the calculation to promote players takes place each time a resource check happens (this is the notification you receive periodically where more money and HR are granted, among other things). Each time a player is promoted, the Points Required are deducted from the playerâ€™s point pool. For example, it takes 50 points to be promoted from Private to Corporal. If the player had 60 points when the next resource check took place, they would be promoted to Corporal and be left with 10 points to start on their climb up to Sergeant.
