   Controlling Radio Towers
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   * Increased chance of intercepting enemy comms
   * Ability to broadcast propaganda to nearby towns to gradually turn them to your side
   * Deny the enemy within the radio tower’s range the ability to call for sup

Destroying Radio Towers
==================================

   Destroying Radio Towers
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   * Deny the enemy the ability to broadcast propaganda to towns and prevent the population from turning to their side
   * Successfully completing the Radio Tower Disrupt mission will delay the next enemy attack even further
   * Note that only completing the Destroy the Radio Tower mission will delay the next enemy attack. Destroying a radio tower with no mission against it will not delay attacks.

   Enemy Controlled Radio Towers
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   * Broadcast propaganda to nearby towns to gradually turn them to the enemy’s side
   * [If using TFAR] Have the possibility of jamming your comms which shortens the broadcast range of your radio equipment
