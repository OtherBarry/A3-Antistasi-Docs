Bank Mission
===============

Category
    :ref:`mission_category_logistics`

.. topic:: Description

  - This mission is quite rare and map dependent. The mission is looking to see if you are in range of a building called “Land_Offices_01_V1_F” and most cities do not have this building, even fewer maps have it. 
  -  Go to a bank with a boxer truck and wait (x) minutes to complete.
  -  The timer will attract all nearby patrols in the vicinity.
  -  The bank is made of glass so this can be hard to pull off.
  -  Get to the top floor and pick enemies off from above.
