Kill The Officer
====================

Category
    :ref:`mission_category_assassination`

.. topic:: Description

  -  The mission is very similar to the “Kill the traitor” mission. The differences are that the unit is already at a established location like an airfield.
  -  Hence, he is protected by all the units within the area, which makes it harder to eliminate the target, unless you can snipe him or hit him with a mortar
