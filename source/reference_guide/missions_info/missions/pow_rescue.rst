   Description
   ^^^^^^^^^^^

   -  A POW is imprisoned in an outpost. You have to free and return him to HQ.
   -  This is a hard mission because you cannot use any explosives to kill the 2-3 squads’ worth of enemy infantry guarding him without murdering the POW.
   -  I recommend staying away from this mission. It’s not worth the effort.

   Outcome
   ^^^^^^^

   *Note that cells which have two values separated by a / indicate that the reward or penalty depends on if the mission was created with a "difficulty" modifier. The difficulty modifier will make the mission harder but increase the payout. The exact formula is: if a random number 1-10 is lower than your War Level then make the mission harder but with higher payout.*
