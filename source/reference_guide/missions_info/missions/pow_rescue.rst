Pow Rescue
============

Category
    :ref:`mission_category_rescue`

.. topic:: Description
 
  -  A POW is imprisoned in an outpost. You have to free and return him to HQ.
  -  This is a hard mission because you cannot use any explosives to kill the 2-3 squads’ worth of enemy infantry guarding him without murdering the POW.
  -  I recommend staying away from this mission. It’s not worth the effort.
