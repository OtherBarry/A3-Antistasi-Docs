.. topic:: Description

  -  Some gendarmes are guarding some refugees in a town. Kill the guards, recruit the refugees by using the drop-down menu on them, then take them back to HQ.
  -  Gendarmes are easy to kill so this should be easier than other missions.
  -  Make sure to take a large vehicle capable of carrying 6+ people.
