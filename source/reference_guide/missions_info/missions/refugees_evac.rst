Refugees Evac
================

Category
    :ref:`mission_category_rescue`

.. topic:: Description

  -  Some gendarmes are guarding some refugees in a town. Kill the guards, recruit the refugees by using the drop-down menu on them, then take them back to HQ.
  -  Gendarmes are easy to kill so this should be easier than other missions.
  -  Make sure to take a large vehicle capable of carrying 6+ people.



.. topic:: Outcome

  *Note that cells which have two values separated by a / indicate that the reward or penalty depends on if the mission was created with a "difficulty" modifier. The difficulty modifier will make the mission harder but increase the payout. The exact formula is: if a random number 1-10 is lower than your War Level then make the mission harder but with higher payout.*
