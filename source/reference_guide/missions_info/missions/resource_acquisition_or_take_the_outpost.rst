      Take the Outpost
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      -  This refers to an outpost as it is marked on the map and sometimes refers to a checkpoint.
      -  If they map marker for the mission is on a road and is not on an outpost, then it is a checkpoint. In which case this is an easy way to gain some gear and money.
      -  Refer to taking a strategic zone section for more tips on capturing outposts.

      Resource Acquisition
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      -  Take a resource depot. You do not have to keep the resource after you take it.
      -  Do not use explosives like mortars or GMGs. civilians are inside and if killed you will incur aggression penalties and the resources will be “destroyed”.
      -  Resources typically have weakened defences compared to outposts.

   Outcome
   ^^^^^^^

   *Note that cells which have two values separated by a / indicate that the reward or penalty depends on if the mission was created with a "difficulty" modifier. The difficulty modifier will make the mission harder but increase the payout. The exact formula is: if a random number 1-10 is lower than your War Level then make the mission harder but with higher payout.*
