Resource Acquisition / Take The Outpost
================================================

Category

.. topic:: Description

  **Take the Outpost**

  -  This refers to an outpost as it is marked on the map and sometimes refers to a checkpoint.
  -  If they map marker for the mission is on a road and is not on an outpost, then it is a checkpoint. In which case this is an easy way to gain some gear and money.
  -  Refer to taking a strategic zone section for more tips on capturing outposts.

  **Resource Acquisition**
  
  -  Take a resource depot. You do not have to keep the resource after you take it.
  -  Do not use explosives like mortars or GMGs. civilians are inside and if killed you will incur aggression penalties and the resources will be “destroyed”.
  -  Resources typically have weakened defences compared to outposts.
