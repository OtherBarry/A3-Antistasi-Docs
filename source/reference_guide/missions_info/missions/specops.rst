.. topic:: Description

  -  A squad of Special forces have been spotted nearby. You must eliminate this squad.
  -  Good way to get some sweet loot.
  -  First spot the enemy while undercover. Then ambush them.
  -  I find mortars and MGs are the easiest way to complete this mission but be careful, spec ops teams often spawn close to minefields
