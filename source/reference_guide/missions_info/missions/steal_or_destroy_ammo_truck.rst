Steal Or Destroy Ammo Truck
=================================

Category
    :ref:`mission_category_logistics`

.. topic:: Description

  -  This is your opportunity to get some sweet gear and an ammo truck to rearm future vehicles and emplacements.
  -  The ammo truck will usually be near an outpost with 1-2 squads of infantry guarding it.
  -  You can simply walk past them as a civilian, get in and drive away. Pedal to the metal because right as you get into that ammo truck, they are going to blast you with everything they have.
  -  It will be helpful to create a plan for escape before executing. Try to avoid the .50 Cal MGs, those are the most likely thing to kill you.
  -  If you do get killed, the vehicle will most likely continue to get fired at until it explodes, so either way mission accomplished.
